11,702,INCHES,"I'd like to have people choose the pant size based on their hip size, rather than waist.  Then I'd like to have an adjustable ""belt"" in the inside of the waist that allows for a range in the waist size.  The back will be gathered (like an elastic waist) based on the tightness of the belt.  This will allow for the various hip/waist ratio that women have and make for a more comfortable fit.  The bottom should be a bit more tapered than the picture so the material doesn't get caught on the foot pegs, or maybe consider a tightening option.",,2022-08-01,,2022-04-27 18:48:48,2022-05-10 14:26:42

We would ideally like to size everything up to avoid issues with this. So a regular UK 10 would be our UK8.",,2023-04-01,Ideally we would also like to produce a small number of underwear in a UK size 6 and a 20.
