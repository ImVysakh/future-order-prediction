I have put 2 tech-packs under 210107001ANB as we only want to use 1 design depending on what works best. Ideally if the halter neck works then we will go with that but we would one a sample made of each to check.

The dates I have put down are guidelines but we want to launch by end of March and have all the products. 

We currently have no care label but we would like a simple label with all UK requirements, stating it is made in Sri Lanka and  any washing care signs. Ideally we would like this simple and in line with our brand.

We would also like a swing tag with string to go around one of the bamboo rings with our logo and some print on the reverse side of the label (we are coming up with this at the moment so TBC).

The fabric I have put down as apparel fabric as it&#039;s clothing but we are looking for linen or linen like, which isn&#039;t see-through, is wickable/breathable and very soft and sustainable.

I have also put 150 pieces with 3 colours but depending on total price per product we may do 2 colours and total of 100 pieces. 

We will have all our products packed in a recycled sari bag (or Sri Lankan equivalent) and swing tagged. Our target price is £15-20 per garment depending on quality of fabric.

I have other logo files etc and our instagram is https://www.instagram.com/atlas.and.bear/ where will hope to promote you and the work you have done as well as giving you an idea of our branding.

Colours are TBC but I think we will have at least one black and one blue (navy-ish blue).

Our Sensory T-Shirts have been designed to help make getting dressed easier whilst also providing a comfortable alternative to traditional cotton t-shirts with our unique fabric blend that helps reduce lingering perspiration odours, eliminates itchy seams and can be worn back-to-front or inside-out!

 
Why consider a Sensory T-Shirt?

Itchy seams and annoying labels can cause both irritation and a negative association with getting dressed – which can make getting ready for school more time consuming and distressing than it should be. Our sensory clothing range eliminates unnecessary irritations and helps your child feel more comfortable during the day.

The reversible design which can also be worn back to front helps alleviate the anxiety of getting changed after P.E. or simply to provide a comfortable alternative to traditional casual wear around the house.",,2021-09-24 12:04:18,2022-11-17 10:59:57,3,402,,,completed,1,2,,,,,,

Please see attached the tech pack, size chart, wash care art work and swing tag artwork.  The tech pack includes artwork for the BNL.

The project is called the Saree Top.  It is a cultural fusion and this first design comprises a stretch velvet women's longsleeved top  with a square neck and a chiffon saree sash travelling from one bottom corner and over the opposite shoulder. 

I have already had one sample made however it needs improvements.  

See also some images of the sample and a list of adjustments needed. 

The highest priority for me at the moment is getting the fabric right.  The problem with the current sample is there is absolutely no stretch in the velvet (its supposed to be dual sized) and its very uncomfortable to wear.  Additionally the chiffon used for the saree sash is cheap quality, looks more like cotton and creases easily. 

The size chart was created by a garment tech in the UK.  The sample has been nicely stitched and so I think the main issue really is the lack of stretch rather than the sizing.   But your thoughts on this would also be welcomed. 

If you would kindly provide an idea of pricing for sample and bulk production as well as what the usual shipping rates, I would be most grateful, 

Thank you,

My name is Ariane, I am the founder and Head designer of the luxurious lingerie and nightwear brand Ariane Delarue. I am looking for new factories based in the EU for manufacturing my collections. 
From now I am working with a small factory based in Barcelona, but their production capacity is small. In June I will be taking part in the International Lingerie Fair in Paris and I hope to get a large amount of orders for this event. I am therefore looking for high quality manufacturers based in Europe only and that could answer to a medium/large production demand.
I am attaching lookbook and I would like to be able to send you tech-packs in order to receive quotes for sampling and production.

Our aim is to be the most sustainable and ethically produced period underwear on the market and it is important for us to be transparent around our manufacturing and to be able to prove that a high level of ethics is met at every level of the supply chain.

We are looking to produce 2 styles of period underwear + a bralette. We currently have a tech pack for 1 or these 2 styles put together from our manufacturer in Bali, but it is more basic than we would like and there are some details that we are looking to change. We would love to get some assistance in re-working this tech pack and adding in the second style. I can provide physical samples and a full brief to help with this.

Additionally, because we obtained our tech pack in Bali, it is in Bahasa, so I attach this to use more as a starting point than a reference on what we are looking for.

In terms of fabrics, we are open to ideas on this but are ideally looking for certified sustainable fabrics such as organic cotton or Tencel. We would like to avoid synthetic fabrics wherever possible.",,2022-05-26 14:39:11,2022-12-11 14:38:55,1,402,,,active,0,1,,,,,,High leg

The bonnet is about 54 cm long and should fit the standard head size.  The bonnet should fit a head size of 58cm but be adjustable to make smaller.

I am writting this email to enquier about information to work with you in my brand. 
My name is Sofía and I am the owner of an upcoming premium lingerie brand based in Spain. We are currently towards the end of production and I am looking for manufacturers that I can work with. 
I would like to get some more information about the companies and the possibility of working together, as well as some references of brands you´ve worked with or pictures of past work. If you would like, we can also arrange a video call or meeting to see and talk about these aspects. 
This first collection I am planning on doing will be based of 10 pieces of clothing, all with different sizes. The brand will be based on sustainability and ethical values, and all materials sourced will be organic and sustainable. That, together with the several components and delicacy that making lingerie requires, explains why it is important for me to choose the perfect manufacturer.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
