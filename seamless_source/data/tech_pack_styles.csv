1,649,"this iconic masterpiece created by mugler and powered by wolford features an innovative body shaping lift construction at the back, offering the most sculpting of fits. finished with solid black front and back center seams, they elegantly accentuate the natural contours of the body.
the contrast between opaque and sheer makes these tights a natural eye-catcher. the matte material feels exceptional and gives a second-skin feel.

7,672,"I attached size chart in previous section with dimensions but I am open to changing the size/ style. 

These are the planned features:

1) sleek design as luxury product with price point above 50 GBP

2) Back of the mask - Concave, deep eye holes so no pressure on the eyes and lash protection. I think memory foam used so easily moulded to face. Eye holes and nose bridge can be the same dimensions as shown in the attachments below. I would like the back of the mask to be covered in the same material (bamboo) as the front of the mask and straps, like what is shown with the SlIP Sleep Mask attachment, in other words, bamboo lining the memory foam. I think this is how SlIP must do it. Also I would like to use a fabric that lines the nose like in the first 2 attachments below as I think this assists with the light blocking aspect. 

3)I am open to design ideas about the shape of the mask but bear in mind there must be enough space for the eye holes and it must be blackout. I think the nose bridge can be the same height as shown in the attachments with dimensions. 
3) For the head strap, I am open to ideas but I'd like it to be elasticated and size- adjustable (so I think velcro is needed). I think this company does this well for their original mask - https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask. I'd like the strap to be covered in bamboo in the same colour as the whole mask so seemless, like Slip - https://www.slip.com/collections/sleep-masks/products/sleep-mask-contour
5) For the materials used, I am not sure what is best to use. I think the concave eyeholes are typically made from memory foam and I'd like the shell of the mask to be in bamboo, but I'm not sure which extra meterials need to be used to give it its rigidity whilst also ensuring its soft. Also, it needs to be100% blackout so I guess several layers of fabric will be needed. This company (https://ostrichpillow.com/products/eye-mask) state they use 6 layers including a foam and a breathable modal fabric. I was thinking cooling memory foam or perforated memory foam would be a good idea to ensure the mask keeps you cool.","Here are the companies I have used for inspiration:

https://ostrichpillow.com/products/eye-mask
https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask-pro
https://www.slip.com/collections/sleep-masks/products/sleep-mask-contour
https://lunya.co/products/washable-silk-sleep-mask
https://gravityblankets.com/collections/weighted-sleep-masks/products/copper-infused-weighted-sleep-mask

I want a sleek design like Ostritch pillow, gravity blanket or Slip's masks, but with the function of Manta's mask. 

I actually like the style of mantas sleep mask quite a lot, espcially how the strap seemlessly fits into the design of the mask, but I don't like how bulky the eye cups are.  I don't want you to be able to see the eye holes on this mask from the front of it. Gravity and lunya also incorporate the strap seemlessly into their deign but I think Lunyas mask and strap are too big, Gravity's mask is better.",NA,NA,,Chanodil need to develop,,1,1,,,2022-03-18 09:47:04,2022-03-18 09:47:04
